# hangman
Hangman game made in C++

This is a game of hangman I made using C++. It shows the use of loops, vectors, and allowing a user to load a file. To play
the game download all files and use the Makefile to compile the game in the command terminal. I also provided three .txt
files that contain 10 words each of varying difficulty. You can use these files to upload words to play with or use the
hardcoded words already in game.cpp. You can even use your own .txt file with your own set of words if you desire to. I will
be adding some updates to the files as there are a few things I need to add such as input validation.
